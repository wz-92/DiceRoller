Dice Roller is a dice rolling simulator for tabletop gaming.

The user is free to specify dice size, number of dice, and a target roll.

There are three modes:

  (1) Roll and Keep High: An amount of dice are rolled against a target and the highest roll is kept.
  (2) Roll and Total: An amount of dice are rolled against a target and then added together.
  (3) Roll and Keep X: An amount of dice are rolled against a target and the highest X dice are kept and added.
